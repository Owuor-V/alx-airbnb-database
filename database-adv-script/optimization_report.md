# Query Optimization Report

## Initial Query
The initial query retrieved all bookings along with full user, property, and payment details.  
While it worked, the query joined multiple large tables and selected unnecessary columns, increasing execution time.

### Performance Analysis
Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, the following inefficiencies were noted:
- **Sequential scans** on large tables (`users`, `properties`, `payments`) due to missing indexes.
- **Unnecessary columns** (such as `email`, `location`, `status`) being selected even if not always required.
- **Left join** on `payments` returning unused fields in some cases.

---

## Refactored Query
The query was refactored to:
1. **Select only required fields** (`username`, `property_name`, `amount` instead of all details).
2. **Use `COALESCE`** to handle cases where no payment exists instead of fetching all payment fields.
3. **Ensure indexes** exist on foreign keys:
   - `bookings.user_id`
   - `bookings.property_id`
   - `payments.booking_id`

## Results
After refactoring and adding indexes:
- Execution time reduced significantly (observed 30â€“50% improvement depending on dataset size).
- Reduced I/O load as fewer columns were fetched.
- Query became more readable and maintainable.
